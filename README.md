# Traffic Flow Simulation

A simple Python script for simulating and visualizing traffic flow on a one-dimensional road.

## Overview

This project provides a basic traffic flow simulation implemented in Python. It models the movement of vehicles on a road, considering acceleration, slowdown due to other vehicles, and random slowdown. The simulation runs for a specified number of time steps, and the state of the road is printed at each step.

## Features

- Simulates a one-dimensional road with vehicles.
- Models acceleration, slowdown due to other vehicles, and random slowdown.
- Provides a basic console-based visualization of the traffic flow.

## Usage

To run the simulation, execute the following command in your terminal:

python TrafficFlowSimulation.py

Requirements
Python 3.x
matplotlib (for plotting)
Install the required dependencies using: pip install -r requirements.txt
